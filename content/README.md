# State Content

The states content .md files are automatically generated by gulp using global state data from `/data/states.json` and language specific data from `/data/translations/<LANG>/state-data.json`

If you edit these files and then run the build command, your edits will be overwritten.

Please make any changes to state details in `/data` files.

Then run `npm run gulp data` to regenerate the content files.

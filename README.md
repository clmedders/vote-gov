## Installation

The development for the `vote.gov` site has the following dependencies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/ "NodeJS Homepage") (Latest LTS version: 16)

This documentation assumes that you have NodeJS installed on your
machine.  Instructions for installing `node`, and `npm`, [can be found here][node-install].

[node-install]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "NodeJS Downloads"

## Development

To install the dependencies navigate to this directory in your Terminal
and tell `npm` to bring in the asset-pipeline's dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Once that is complete, run `npm run gulp` in your Terminal to get a list of tasks.

```sh
npm run gulp

  Using gulpfile ~/Developer/vote-gov/gulpfile.js
  Starting 'default'...

  Available tasks

  ...
```

To start the local webserver for the English and Spanish site and have hugo watch
for changes:

```sh
npm start
```

Optional: To additionally have gulp watch for changes to the assets and content folder run this command instead: 

```sh
npm run dev
```

The English website is now available at [`http://localhost:1313/`](http://localhost:1313/).

The Spanish website is now available at [`http://localhost:1313/es/`](http://localhost:1313/es/).

### Descriptions for optional `gulp [ flags ]` task prefixes

These flags are 100% optional and can be omitted from any tasks that are
affected by them.

- `no-test` This flag disables linters and tests for all assets.
- `production` This flag enables minification and compression of all assets in
  prep for a production environment.

## Deployment

The microsite is deployed on [Federalist.18f.gov][fed-homepage]. To read `Federalist`
documentation, [click here][fed-docs]. The documentation below makes the
following assumptions.

- Assuming that you have Federalist access. 
    - [Please read _Access and Permissions_](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/access-permissions/) for more
      Information.

### Automated deployment

This project uses [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) for continuous deployment. Our
current process deploys our `staging` branch and our `master` branch to their
own [`staging`][vote-staging] and [`production`][vote-production] URLs.

To view the build for another branch, see the links below and replace <BRANCH> with the name of the branch. The build for the branch must have completed successfully. 

For production builds: https://cg-9e8debaf-b030-4825-a43c-cb2bc850c96c.app.cloud.gov/preview/usagov/vote-gov/<BRANCH>/ 

For staging builds: https://cg-82f344a8-cccc-4f34-b090-19d55b2b6585.app.cloud.gov/preview/usagov/vote-gov/<BRANCH>/ 

[vote-staging]: TBD "Vote USA: Staging"
[vote-production]: https://vote.gov "Vote USA: Production"

### Manual deployment

Using the `cf` command-line tool, you can run a manual deployment to either
`staging` or `production` by targeting the corresponding organization / space
and as long as you have access to `cf push` the target. More information on
deploying to `cloud.gov` can be found [here][cg-deploy-hw] and [here][cg-deploy-ss].

[cg-deploy-hw]: https://docs.cloud.gov/getting-started/your-first-deploy/ "Cloud.gov: Your First Deploy"
[cg-deploy-ss]: https://docs.cloud.gov/apps/static/ "Cloud.gov: Deploying Static Sites"

> Manual deployments are not necessary as all deployments _should_ go through
> Federalist.

Information about launching a live site on Federalist can be found at the [launch checklist](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/launch-checklist/).

To check which space you're targeting using the `cf` command-line tool, type the
following in your terminal.

```sh
cf target
```

#### Building the `vote.gov` site locally

To build the `vote.gov` site locally , run  `npm start` . This command calls the `gulp website` task and starts the hugo server.  

To mimic the Federalist build run `npm run federalist`. To start the server run `hugo server` .


#### Continuous delivery

Federalist is a continuous deployment-like build environment that automatically pushes the vote.gov application for staging and production.
Any commits made to `staging` will be automatically built on Federalist. 

### Vote.usa.gov redirector

During the re-launch of `vote.gov`, we realised that there were lingering
issues with cached redirects between `vote.gov` and `vote.usa.gov`. To
fix this, we created a minimal nginx configuration which:

  * redirects front page requests to `https://vote.gov/?1` (the query string
    was added to defeat a previously-cached 301 redirect)
  * redirects all other file requests to the original S3 bucket containing
    the `vote.usa.gov` assets

The manifest and configuration for this redirector app can be found in the
`redirector` folder.
